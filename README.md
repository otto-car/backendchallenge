Wordpress Challenge
====================

This code challenge allows you to demonstrate your ability to build a simple Wordpress plugin, and gives us a chance to see how you code and how you use version control.

## Things we're looking for
- Clean & readable code is super important, as it means it's easier for people to read, reuse, and refactor your work.
- Good use of version control means it's easy for people to check and review your code.
- [Using a testing framework](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/automated-testing-wordpress-plugins-phpunit/) (where applicable) means you're more likely to deliver robust code.

## The Challenge

We deal with lots and lots of cars on a day-to-day basis, specifically in the context of Private Hire Vehicles (PHV), so naturally this will be related to private hire vehicles. 

### The _Uber_ Clean Air Plan

London is moving towards a zero-emission future and Uber is committed to lowering air pollution.  
  
 Uber launched their Clean Air Plan earlier this year, which helps drivers have been making lots of savings towards owning a fully electric Uber Car.

From January 2019, 15p per mile is now being applied to every customer picked up in London (within the M25), and all of the money raised by the driver has gone towards the price of an upgrade to an electric vehicle (EV). 

Since April 2019, the Congestion Charge and ULEZ has increased driving costs for many PCO drivers.

However, Electric Vehicles will be exempt from the Congestion Charge (until 2025), which is why Uber wants to help as many drivers as possible make the transition sooner rather than later.

### _Uber_'s Partnership with _Otto Car_

Otto Car are one of only two approved lenders with the Uber Clean Air Plan.

This means that since Otto Car are a preferred Uber Vehicle Partner in London, we have an exclusive programme available to Uber Partners wishing to purchase or rent a car using your Uber Clean Air savings.

### How it Works

Drivers must have a minimum of £1000 with the Uber Clean Air Plan to get a discount on our  [Rent 2 Buy scheme](https://ottocar.co.uk/rent-to-buy/).

The amount they have in their funds would be discounted from the full cost of their contract. 

### Simplified (Fake) Example

- Our _Otto Car Model C_ is on our Rent to Buy Scheme for £20 per week, on a 12 month (52 week) contract.
- The Driver has £200 in their _Uber_ Clean Air fund.

Instead of the driver paying £20 per week, the £200 would be spread across the length of the contract to reduce their weekly payments. 

So, £20 per week * 52 weeks = £1040 over the entire length of the contract. 

Their Uber Clean Air fund, which is £200, is deducted from that amount so that the full cost of their contract is now £840.

If we divide £840 by the length of the contract in weeks (52 weeks), then their weekly rental is now £16.15 a week instead.


## Your task

Your task is to build an **_Uber_ Clean Air Plan Calculator**, where the user would select a car (out of the six we have on our Rent 2 Buy scheme) and be able to select how much money they have on their Uber Clean Air fund, in order to see how much of a discount they can get on their weekly payments if they take out a car with Otto Car.

Some notes:

- The six car along with their weekly prices and contract lengths can be seen [here](https://i.imgur.com/dQOMkk3.png).
- Photos of each of the cars can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/CBxPAgk) (one of the photos is repeated, it's because we offer the same car model in two different configurations).
- A driver can have a minimum of £1000, and a maximum of £5000.

We do not want to suggest any UX/UI, as designing a friendly and responsive UI will be part of your evaluation as well.

####  Requirements
-------
- Clean, readable, maintainable codebase.
- Source code on Github.
- Friendly UX/UI, that corresponds with our colour scheme.
- Your plugin must be responsive on mobile.
- Your plugin must be resilient and fault tolerant.

####  Submission

Email over a link to your code on GitHub, with instructions in your README on how to prepare the code for upload to Wordpress.

Your plugin **will be tested in a Wordpress environment**.
